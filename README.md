* ## Ischemic Stroke Risk Factors Analysis:
    
    This research aims to determine the association between certain biochemical indicators and the incidence of ischemic stroke. It is an investigation focused on ischemic stroke within the field of neurology.

    Data:
    The data were obtained from the Harvard Dataverse, where all relevant information was exclusively derived from the medical records of Fuzhou People's Hospital in China. The case group comprised 130 patients admitted to the Neurology Department of Fuzhou People's Hospital for the treatment of ischemic stroke [source](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/U1ELA6). Here is the study conducted by the authors who published the data: [study](https://jnsbm.org/article-view/?id=226) XU Y, Hwa W E, Nordin R B, Mohaideen A K M, Earnest B S P, How W Y, Le Huahui L. Risk Factors and Gender Difference in the Prediction of Ischemic Stroke in China. J Nat Sc Biol Med 2023;14:141-150.

    Approach:
    In this project, a binary classification study will be conducted to determine whether the patient is at risk of experiencing an ischemic stroke and to understand the most important risk factors. Standard classification algorithms, ensemble algorithms, and Boosting algorithms will be utilized for this purpose.
